    <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

        The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
        
        jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
        
        jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
        
        The jQuery library contains the following features:
        
        HTML/DOM manipulation
        CSS manipulation
        HTML event methods
        Effects and animations
        AJAX
        Utilities
        Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.
